# Utility Functions for Audio Analysis

This package incorporates all functions created and used for the audio analysis. Install it using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/yancyvance/audio-analysis.git`

The analysis mainly uses MP3 files and does the conversion behind the scenes.

This is a work in progress.
